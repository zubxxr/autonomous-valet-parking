# Autonomous Valet Parking

This repository provides a framework for running autonomous valet parking simulations with **Autoware**, **AWSIM Labs**, and YOLO-based parking spot detection.

When combined with Autoware, AWSIM, YOLOv5, and Unity-based scripts for bounding box visualization, the system enables a fully autonomous valet parking flow â€” from perception to path planning and final parking.
