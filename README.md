The **Autonomous Valet Parking Framework** integrates **Autoware**, **AWSIM Labs**, and **YOLOv5-based parking spot detection** into a unified simulation flow â€” from perception to autonomous parking.  

It enables a complete valet parking experience inside simulation, with automated parking spot detection, goal assignment, and route execution.
